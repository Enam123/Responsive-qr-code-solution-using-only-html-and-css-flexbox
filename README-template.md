## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm really proud of all the codes I've written. I found during the coding that making it responsive was hard but I used percentage instead of pixels for the height and the result was really good. 


### Continued development

The responsiveness is what I'll like to improve on and perfect.
